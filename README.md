This is a sample to learn how to use GetHub.

Hi All,

I enjoy playing disc golf, swimming, and occasionally coding.  I'm trying out this website for my Cloud Computing class.  I found the first class to be very interesting but I'm a little nervious for the work required for the class. I hope as I put forth the effort it will eventually come together and I'll be able to learn things that will help me.
